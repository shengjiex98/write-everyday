# Combating Fake News with Adversarial Domain Adaptation and Neural Models

## Ideas

- Fact checking
- Stance Detection
- Adversarial Domain Adaptation

## Domain adaptation techniques

- Minimal dataset specific alteration
  - E.g. sample data from carefully selected source domain which is similar to the target domain (landmarks).
- Feature space transformation
  - Transfer component analysis -- find transfer components across domains such that data from different domains have similar distribution.
- Adversarial domain adaptation
  - Produce features so that source and target domains cannot be distinguished easily.
