# PC Troubleshooting Tips

## Components

*Louqe Ghost S1* has standoffs that are too small and won't support certain motherboards correctly =_= (fixed in Mk III)

If the *graphics card* is not properly seated in the PCIE slot there could be random black screens with `dwm.exe` crushing (evident by EventID 1000 in Event Viewer). Reseating the graphics card might solve the problem.

## Drivers and software

### AMD Processors

Install the *AMD Chipset Software* manually as it is currently not automatically installed by Windows.

### Asus MB

No sound: need to download the soundcard driver manually (IKR? in 2022?).
