# Timing Debugging for Cyber-Physical Systems

## Ideas

- currently studied
  - schedulability analysis
  - scheduling algorithms
- Not studied
  - What to change when unable to schedule?

How to assess the change to the system dynamics? In this paper it is defined as minimal shifts to the system poles. There are other possible metrics, e.g. peak overshoot, settling time, root sum square difference etc.
